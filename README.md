## Bézier Curve

SVG plus HTML5 Drag and Drop to show the resulting cubic bézier curve when altering the control points.
The bézier curve's end points have been anchored to show the resulting time function for SVG Animations.

## Custom Drop Down Menus

**select.html**

Work for a jQuery-based add-on for drop down menus that can be easily styled with CSS.

I would like to remove the jQuery code and ensure this can be used as an add-on in any site for all major browsers.

This, sadly, does not use the <select> HTML markup, but instead <input type="text" list="..."/> and either JSON or <ul>

### Known Browser Support
* Chrome 24+
* IE8+
