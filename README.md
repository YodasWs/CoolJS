## Custom Drop Down Menus

**select.html**

Work for a jQuery-based add-on for drop down menus that can be easily styled with CSS.

I would like to remove the jQuery code and ensure this can be used as an add-on in any site for all major browsers.

This, sadly, does not use the <select> HTML markup, but instead <input type="text" list="..."/> and either JSON or <ul>
